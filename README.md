## General Information
- We have to accurately detect a kind of skin cancer called Melanoma from the images provided.
- Amongst different kind of skin conditions, Melanoma is the reson for 75% of skin cancer deaths every year.
- Dataset contains different images of 9 classes of skin condition including that of Melanoma.
- The CNN model should detect Melanoma to take pecaution in order to avoid the havok outcome.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- A 3 layer CNN model has been created with Relu activation function to achieve 86.56 % accuracy.
- As this is a classification problem, we have used Softmax activation function in the output layer.
